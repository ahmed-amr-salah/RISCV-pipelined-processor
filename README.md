#  About This Project:
Verilog-based RISC-V pipelined processor that supports 40 RISC-V instructions, showcasing technical prowess with
the incorporation of a Hazard Detection Unit, Forwarding unit, and a unified dual-memory for instructions and
data.

## Features: 
### Supports The following Instructions:
+ R-Type Functions: Support for register-register operations, including arithmetic and logical instructions.
+ I-Type Functions: Implementation of immediate operations, load instructions, and conditional branches.
+ S-Type Functions: Capability to handle store instructions.
+ U-Type Functions: Support for upper immediate operations and long jumps.
### Pipelined Architecture
